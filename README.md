# Optimizing System Performance for SIP servers

There are many guides online about Linux kernel and TCP/UDP tuning, I tried to sum the most useful and detailed Linux kernel useful to scale and handle more concurrent connections on a SIP server such as Asterisk or Kamailio.

This is the **/etc/sysctl.conf** file I use on my servers (CentOS 6):

```
#
# Tunned Kernel sysctl configuration file for Linux
#
# Version 1.0 - 2018-02-15
# Rebtel - <oussama.hammami@rebtel.com>
#
# This file should be saved in /etc/sysctl.d/ and can be activated using the command:
# sysctl -e -p /etc/sysctl.d/70-rebtel-tuning.conf
#

# Disable ipv6
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 0

# Usually SIP uses TCP or UDP to carry the SIP signaling messages over the internet (<=> TCP/UDP sockets).
# The receive buffer (socket receive buffer) holds the received data until it is read by the application.
# The send buffer (socket transmit buffer) holds the data until it is read by the underling protocol in the network stack.

And this is the **/etc/security/limits.conf** :

```

```

To add a new user limits, you can copy paste this file in `/etc/security/limits.d/` and replace root by your process name.

**Example** for asterisk:

```
# sed -i 's/root/asterisk/g' 50-asterisk.limits.conf
``` 

# Increasing the Limit in Systemd

> Note that systemd ignores limits set in the /etc/security/limits.conf and /etc/security/limits.d/*.conf configuration files. The limits defined in these files are set by PAM when starting a login session, but daemons started by systemd do not use PAM login sessions.
